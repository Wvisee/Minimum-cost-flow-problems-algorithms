# Comparison of standard optimal flow algorithms and randomized optimal flow algorithms

This repository contains the code used in my master thesis. The code inside this directory is the one used to make the comparison between the algorithms implemented.
The algorithms can be found inside the algorithm directory. It is split into the minimum cost flow algorithms and the maximum cost flow algorithms.

### dependencies
Here are the dependencies to install to run the code in this repository
```bash
pip3 install networkx scipy ortools matplolib pandas
```
